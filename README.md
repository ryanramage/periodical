About
-----

Periodical is like a 'CI server', but used only for publishing JS modules to multiple package managers. Just add a webhook to github, and on every commit you can have up to date packages. The default is to only publish from the master branch, but periodical has very flexible configration.

Status
------

This is currently a very early WIP. I wont not recommend using it yet tell it has stabilized slightly.
